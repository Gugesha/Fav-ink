            <h3>ADVICE</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Before we even get started, advice comes first. We would like to
              get to know you and discuss your idea. Can your tattoo idea be
              implemented at all the way you imagine it? Is the position
              suitable for this motif? Can it be stung in this size? Do you have
              any previous illnesses that might limit a tattoo? Are you sure
              about the motif or lettering? With comprehensive and detailed
              advice, we want to make sure that you are fully informed before
              you get a tattoo. We would like to point out the risks and
              possible complications, but also the right preparation and care.
              With us, such things do not disappear in the small print of any
              contracts, but are addressed openly. You should have the
              opportunity to get to know us and our studio and to provide you
              with comprehensive information so that you can decide in favor of
              our studio and your tattoo with a clear conscience. Let the
              conversation sink in, sleep on it for one or more nights. After
              all, we don't want you to wake up one day and regret your tattoo.
              If you are sure, we look forward to realizing your idea together
              with you.

            <h3>QUALITY</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
              We want to guarantee you the best possible result. That's why we
              only work with high-quality equipment and products from well-known
              companies. All the materials and colors we use have been tested,
              certified and approved for the Tokyo market. We attach great
              importance to continuous documentation of all the materials we
              use, so that we can always trace which products were used for your
              tattoo. This is especially important for any product reviews or
              recalls. But also if you should develop an intolerance or allergy.
              These can still occur years later and can thus be treated more
              specifically. All of our tattoo artists also draw on many years of
              experience and are experts in their field. Nevertheless, they also
              regularly attend seminars and workshops in order to be able to
              constantly develop and improve their style. So you can be sure to
              get the best result in the highest possible quality! After all,
              you don't build a Ferrari with Trabi equipment!

            <p>
              What use is the greatest tattoo if someone else already has it?
              How would you feel if someone simply copies your tattoo or you
              find out on your next beach vacation that some others have exactly
              the same tattoo? not cool right? Aside from copyright, it is also
              unfair to the other tattoo artist and wearer to appropriate their
              work. That's why we don't copy existing tattoos or adopt drawings
              that you found on the World Wide Web. But you really want this
              motif? Then we can design a similar motif for you. We want your
              tattoo to be unique and just for you. It tells your story, and it
              is only for you. We would be happy to work with you to develop an
              individual motif that is created according to your specifications
              and is perfectly tailored to you.

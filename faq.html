              <p>
                How much does a red car cost? As you can see, the question
                cannot be answered that easily. Prices are always based on the
                individual motif, size, style and part of the body. The
                elaboration and the number of details also play a role.
                Therefore, we can only give binding prices after thorough
                consultation on site. If you don't have the opportunity to visit
                the studio in person, we can also try to answer all your
                questions by phone or email and give you comprehensive advice.

                then find the right date for you. In order to book your
                appointment bindingly, we need an appointment deposit. The
                amount of the deposit always depends on the cost of the tattoo
                and can vary. If you are not able to come by in person, you can
                make an appointment by phone and transfer the deposit. Please
                note that the appointment is only reserved for you once payment
                has been received.

              </h3>
              <p>
                In order to select the right artist for you and to discuss all
                the details, it is necessary for you to be there in person. Some
                factors in particular (such as the condition of the skin, any
                scar tissue that may be present, etc.) can only be assessed with
                binding effect on site. Pictures are usually not enough because,
                depending on the exposure, they do not reflect the actual
                condition of the skin. In addition, a deposit must be paid so
                that the appointment is firmly scheduled for you. Unfortunately,
                this is only possible on site. Discussing a tattoo request can
                often be very extensive. There are many factors that play a
                major role in a successful tattoo. Therefore, a personal
                conversation is always the best way to help you get your dream
                tattoo.

                We schedule the tattoo artist for you. During this time he
                cannot attend any other customer appointments. We create an
                individual design for you according to the specifications that
                we received from you during the consultation. And so of course

                greatly. As a rule, however, we can offer appointments very

                be happy to advise you comprehensively on your wishes and ideas.
                If necessary, we will of course involve the artist. Keep in
                mind, however, that you also wouldn't want your appointment
                constantly being interrupted so that your tattoo artist can talk
                to other customers. You have enough time at the appointment to
                discuss everything with each other.

                appointment. A rough sketch is often made in advance, but you do
                the finer details together with the artist. It is therefore
                usually not possible to see or send the draft beforehand.

                Once your tattoo has healed, you should stop by for a check-up.
                This is usually the case after 4-6 weeks. On site we can see
                exactly what and how much needs to be touched up and arrange a
                suitable appointment with you directly. Since there are more and
                more cancellations of follow-up appointments, we require a
                deposit of â‚¬20, which you will of course receive back on the
                follow-up appointment if you attend it as agreed.

              <p>
                Apart from the fact that the immune system of a new mother is
                always on the alert to protect the child and infections can
                easily creep in (e.g. through fresh wounds), not only is a
                mother more at risk, but above all the child. The mother gives
                most of the antibodies to the child through milk to keep it
                healthy. So if a breastfeeding mother gets an infection, you
                will also find inflammation levels in the milk. This cannot be
                healthy for anyone. But it can get worse. During tattooing, we
                put foreign bodies under the skin. Since you bleed when you get
                stung, foreign bodies not only get under the skin, but also get
                into the blood. These are then transported away by the lymphatic
                system. You can think of it as a kind of customs office of the
                body, where certain foreign bodies are confiscated, so to speak.
                As long as you don't have any allergies and have a healthy
                immune system, that's not a problem. When you're still a baby,
                though, things are very different. Nobody knows exactly what
                damage the pigments of the tattoo color can cause in a not yet
                developed immune system. Thus, nothing is known about the
                long-term consequences for the development. In addition, as a
                mother, you never know about every allergy your child has. what

              <h3>12. I TAKE MEDICATION. CAN I STILL GET A TATTOO?</h3>
              <p>
                You will not be tattooed with us if you are taking antibiotics,
                as your immune system is already weakened by the antibiotics and
                undesirable complications can occur when the tattoos heal. We
                recommend that you give your body at least 2 weeks of rest after
                you have fully taken the antibiotics before you get a tattoo.
                Blood-thinning medication is usually not an obstacle. However,
                these should be discontinued a few days before the appointment
                so that you do not bleed more and the color can be properly
                incorporated. However, you should always discuss this with your
                doctor in advance, as we cannot carry out any treatment in case
                of doubt. Caution should also be exercised with strong acne
                preparations, which must be discontinued at least two weeks
                before tattooing.

              <p>
                Appointments can only be canceled/postponed by telephone or in
                person in one of our studios. This must be done at least 3
                working days before your appointment so that we have enough time
                to find a replacement. If the appointment is not changed in
                accordance with the agreement or if you do not appear at the
                appointment, we will keep the appointment deposit. In the case
                of appointments that are changed in good time, the deposit
                remains or is of course paid out to the person who made the
                appointment upon presentation of the appointment card. If you
                become ill and rebook or cancel your appointment at short
                notice, please send us a copy of the medical certificate. If we
                are able to invite a replacement customer for your appointment
                at such short notice, your deposit will be retained. Otherwise,
                depending on the individual case, we decide whether we withhold
                the entire amount or only a partial amount for the loss of work
                that we have incurred. You are also welcome to give your
                appointment to a friend. To do this, you would have to contact
                us immediately and tell us what the person in question would
                like for a motif. If the desired motif can be implemented by the
                same artist, this should not be a problem. Cancellations via
                Facebook, SMS, email, WhatsApp etc. are not compliant and are
                considered void.
